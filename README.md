# Stargrave Reference Cards

This is a collection of material to support players of Stargrave. I find it tricky to constantly skim rulebooks looking for stats and clarifications, especially now there are 5 expansions. I designed a series of cards and documents to help keep track of common stats and rules.

Stargrave: Science Fiction Wargames in the Ravaged Galaxy, is a game by Joseph A. McCullough, published by [Osprey Games](https://www.ospreypublishing.com/uk/stargrave-9781472837509/). Stargrave and the expansions are &copy; Joseph A. McCullough.

The files in this project require you own the appropriate books, and will not be useful without access to the rules. Details of how powers, attributes and creatures work are in the rulebooks and the material here is just an aide memoire.

These cards include information from:
* Stargrave (SG)
* Dead or Alive (DoA)
* The Last Prospector (LP)
* Quarantine 37 (Q37)
* Hope Eternal (HE)
* Bold Endeavour (BE)

See the pdfs folder for the following:
## Attribute Reference
A formatted Excel sheet that is useful for referencing attitubes on one page
## Power Cards
A reimplementation of the [Osprey cards](https://www.ospreypublishing.com/uk/osprey-blog/2021/stargrave-power-cards/) including powers from expansions. They are the same size as the Osprey cards if you already have them, you only need the last two pages.
## Stat Cards
Stat lines, notes and weapon stats for character archetypes and bestiary entries. For crew the cost is shown at the bottom left. These cards are designed for small 43x65 card sleeves.

## Note on interpretation
These documents are not direct copies of rules - they have been summarised and shortened in the cards. This is to keep cards simple. For example attributes that represent weapons appear as weapons on stat cards, rather than attributes. So, "Strong" becomes a +2 modifier for the character's weapon. I have also not included cards for "one off" enemies such as those in the Dead or Alive supplement. Some cards cannot fit all the rules, and you will need to refer to the rulebooks in these cases. Similarly, the rulebook gives excellent examples, and flavour, for characters, attributes and powers. This is missing from the cards here. All cards identify the rulebook(s) where you can find the descriptions by acronym (e.g. HE: Hope Eternal). 

It is very likely I have made errors in this process. The official rulebooks and errata remain the definitive source.

# Printing
All pdfs are set to A4 greyscale printing. You can print directly on cardstock or onto paper then cut and glue.

# Editing
If there are issues with specific cards you can raise them with the Github issues system in this repository, and maybe one day I might get to it, or feel free to fork this project. I won't accept Pull Requests that just edit output/generated files, as these will be overwritten next time I generate them. I'm genuinely happy for you to fork this project and fiddle around with it.

The source files are included, and comprise a series of Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, CSV export files, and Affinity Publisher 2 files for layouts and intermediate outputs. The Affinity Publisher 2 files have two sorts: first a template file that is set to draw data from the CSV. The second is the merged version if specific cards need small tweaks. Note that each card is its own page, so will need to be tiled for printing from Affinity.
